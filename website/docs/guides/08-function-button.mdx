# Function button

Sometimes some movements are triggered even if you did not mean it.

Since that version, 8Vim has a new button on the sidebar called `fn`.

If this button/feature is disabled some actions/movements marked as `function` won't be triggered. By default, this feature is on.

## Disabled icon on the sidebar

![fn_not_enabled](/img/fn-button/not-selected.png)

## Enabled icon on the sidebar

![fn_enabled](/img/fn-button/selected.png)

## Settings

The state when the keyboard is shown depends on the settings (default enabled)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/fn-button/settings.mp4" />

## Example

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/fn-button/example.mp4" />
