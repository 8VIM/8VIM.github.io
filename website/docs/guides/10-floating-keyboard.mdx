# Floating keyboard

8VIM acquired the ability to be detached for the bottom of the screen and 
be drag around/resized.

Tablets or large devices in landscape mode will set 8VIM as floating, but you
will always be able to to snap it back to the bottom of the screen if it's your
preference

## Examples

<ReactPlayer controls url="/videos/floating/phone.mp4" />

### Foldable phone

<ReactPlayer controls url="/videos/floating/fold.mp4" />
