# What is 8Vim?

The application was started essentially as a clone of 8pen, which for some reason they have stopped distributing. (I can no longer install it, even though I paid for it!)

To understand how this keyboard works, check the [[Usability Guide|Usability Guide]] or [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99vsUF4NuLk) on 8pen (the forerunner of 8Vim)

## Handwriting Reinvented

The 8vim draws inspiration from handwriting. By mimicking the way our hand moves when constrained to a square canvas, we are able to create a natural and fun writing experience, akin to doodling on a piece of paper.

## Designed for Speed

The layout is optimised for fast writing, by allowing for the most common letter sequences to be produced with swift, fluid gestures. Once familiar with the layout, you can reach speeds of over 40 words per minute!

## Typos, goodbye

The simplicity of the gestures used to enter words, allow for true blind typing and virtually eliminate typos. Regardless of whether you have small or big fingers. Word suggestions become an optimisation, not a dependency.
