# Language file layout

This page will explain the file format used by `8VIM` and how to make it available.

## Overview

The file uses `YAML` to describe the layout and keyboard to be rendered.

The layout supports 5 visible layers, the first one being the default keyboard rendered.

The other layers can be used, for example, to render diatrics, special symbols of your language.

It also supports a hidden layer which is not rendered but can be useful for handling special actions/characters.
