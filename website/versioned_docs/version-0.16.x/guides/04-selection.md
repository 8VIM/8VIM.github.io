# Selection

There is a selection mode built into the keyboard. If you move your finger from the right sector to the circle and hold, the cursor will start moving left while selecting everything in its path, until you lift your finger. Once you release, the selection mode keyboard will open and show different actions that can then be applied to your selection. 

> i.e.:
> 
> - `right`
> - `circle`
> - `hold`
> - `lift`
