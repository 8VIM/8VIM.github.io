# Cursor Movements

If you move your finger from within the circle to any sector, the cursor will move one character in the direction of the sector. For example, if you swipe from the circle to the right sector and then raise your finger, the cursor will move to the right once. If you don't lift up your finger but instead keep pressing on the sector, the cursor will move as long as the sector is pressed.
