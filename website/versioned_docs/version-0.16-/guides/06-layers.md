# Layers

8VIM supports up to 6 layers.

Every language has at least one layer, the default one.
Some languages can have multiple layers to handle specific characters like accents.

### Activation

To switch to layer selection do: `bottom` -> `circle`.

Then go back to `bottom` for the second layer. If you turn clockwise you change to the other layers.
Once you are happy with the layer go back to `circle` and select the character as usual.
